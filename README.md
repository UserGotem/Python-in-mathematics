# Three Math Projects in Python

This project showcases three Python notebooks that delve into various mathematical concepts and data analysis techniques. Each notebook focuses on a specific aspect of mathematics and demonstrates its application through real-world data.

## Project Overview

* **Number Matching Analysis:** This notebook analyzes the results of a number matching game to understand player behavior, strategies, and performance patterns.

* **Fraction Conversion Patterns:** This notebook investigates patterns in fraction conversion errors to identify common misconceptions and develop targeted learning interventions.

* **Equation Solving Strategies:** This notebook examines the strategies employed by students when solving math equations to gain insights into their problem-solving approaches and identify areas for improvement.

## Notebook Descriptions

**Number Matching Analysis:**

* This notebook utilizes machine learning techniques to classify player behaviors and identify patterns in their interactions with the number matching game.
* It analyzes the factors that influence player performance and provides insights into the game's effectiveness in promoting learning.

**Fraction Conversion Patterns:**

* This notebook explores the distribution of fraction conversion errors across different types of fraction problems (decimals, percentages, mixed numbers).
* It identifies common misconceptions and patterns in error types, providing guidance for developing targeted instructional strategies.

**Equation Solving Strategies:**

* This notebook employs natural language processing techniques to analyze student explanations for their solutions to math equations.
* It identifies the strategies students use to solve equations and uncovers patterns in their problem-solving approaches.

## Technical Implementation

* Python's libraries, including `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `nltk`, were used to develop the notebooks.
* `numpy` and `pandas` handled data manipulation and analysis tasks.
* `scikit-learn` was employed for machine learning algorithms and classification tasks.
* `nltk` was used for natural language processing and text analysis.

## Findings and Insights

* The analysis of number matching data revealed insights into player preferences, strategies, and performance factors.
* The investigation of fraction conversion patterns identified common misconceptions and provided guidance for targeted interventions.
* The examination of equation solving strategies revealed patterns in student approaches and suggested areas for improvement.
